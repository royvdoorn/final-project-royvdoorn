# Final Assignment

This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the results of the models that have submitted on the Cityscapes competition by Roy van Doorn (username: Royvdoorn - email: r.v.doorn1@student.tue.nl).

## Dependencies

The train and visualization code will run without additional dependencies besides the librairies present on snellius. For the GFLOP calculations the thop and time dependencies are required.
